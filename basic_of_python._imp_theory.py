To learn about the pyton we have to first know the basic terminology of python:
1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.
2. In python we have data types, variables, operators, control flow statements, functions, and modules.
3. Data types in python include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
4. Variables are used to store data values. In python, you don't need to declare the type of variable explicitly.
5. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
6. Control flow statements like if, for, and while are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
There are two types of data types: primitive and non-primitive data types.
Primitive data types include:
1. Integer: Represents whole numbers, e.g., 1, -5, 42
2. Float: Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.001
3. String: Represents sequences of characters, e.g., "Hello, World!"
4. Boolean: Represents truth values, either True or False
Non-primitive data types include:
1. List: An ordered collection of items, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
2. Tuple: An ordered, immutable collection of items, e.g., (1, 2, 3), ("red", "green", "blue")
3. Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
4. Set: An unordered collection of unique items, e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
In python, in the varible if x = 8 it doesnt mean x is equal to 8 it means x "gets" 8 or x "becomes" 8 or x " is assigned to" 8 etc 
but it is not equal to  lhs( left hand side) and rhs ( right hand side) are not same in python
Example:
x = 8  # Here, x is assigned the value 8
